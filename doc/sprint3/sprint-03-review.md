## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 18, 2024
 * Where: Online (Discord)

## Process - Reflection

During this sprint, we focused on refining our processes to enhance team efficiency and product quality.

#### Decisions that turned out well

1. Task Assignment
    
    This sprint's we decided to assign tasks in a different way which ended up being successful due to consideration of interdependencies. By assigning specific roles—such as UI improvements for order visibility, development of the notification system, enhancing the customer-side ordering and courier-side acceptance interfaces, etc. roles which each involved several tasks—we ensured that each team member could focus on a grouping of similar tasks, minimizing blockers and increasing efficiency due to the similarity of tasks.
    
2. Setting Clear Sprint Goals

	Defining clear and achievable sprint goals provided the team with a focused direction and measurable objectives. This clarity helped prioritize tasks effectively, track progress accurately, and maintain motivation throughout the sprint.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Overlapping Sprint Tasks with Maintenance Work

Our decision to overlap sprint tasks with ongoing maintenance work ended up complicating certain tasks. While the intention was to maximize productivity, the dual focus hindered some progress due to the fact that maintenance work would be done on one branch while sprint tasks were done seperately on an unmaintained copy of the files. This decision outlined that it may be helpful to order certain tasks in terms of completion in order to avoid certain inefficiencies.

2. Overlooking Minor Bugs

	Minor bugs very overlooked, which eventually led to a buildup of small issues that collectively degraded the user experience such as in the map components. The bugs were resolved during the refactoring process, but complicated the task. This decision emphasized the need to address all levels of bugs to maintain overall application quality.

#### Planned changes

1. Separate Development and Maintenance Tasks

	We will separate feature development from maintenance tasks to avoid inneficiencies. This change aims to streamline our workflow and ensure that both development and maintenance receive adequate attention without causing conflicts.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. Order status updating
    - Artifact: The [order tracking page](../../app/frontend/src/pages/OrderTracking.tsx)

## Meeting Highlights

1. Improve Code Review Processes: Continue to emphasize the importance of thorough code reviews to maintain high code quality . This will lead to a more maintainable codebase.

2. Maintain Regular Communication: Ensure consistent and regular check-ins to improve alignment and prevent misunderstandings. This will help promptly address any issues that arise.
