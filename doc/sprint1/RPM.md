## Release Goal:

Our release goal for this sprint is to lay the groundwork for the infrastructure required by our app. This includes setting up databases, frameworks/libraries, and ensuring the components are integrated together. We want to intialize components, pages, and complete the key foundational features that will allow us to easily continue developing future features ontop of our groundwork. In particular, features related to authentication, and the main ordering delivery functionality. We would also want to finalize our schema/data model so that the rest of our development process can be worked ontop of a consistent model.
